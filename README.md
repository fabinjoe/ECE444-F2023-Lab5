### Pros and Cons of Test-Driven Development (TDD)
Test-driven development offers several advantages, including enhanced code quality and reduced software defects. By writing tests before code implementation, TDD provides rapid feedback, enabling quicker identification and resolution of issues. TDD also fosters better design practices, promoting modular and maintainable code. Additionally, it ensures that existing functionality remains intact through continuous regression testing and serves as a form of documentation for the codebase, facilitating ease of comprehension by new team members.

However, TDD does come with its own set of challenges. The approach may impose an initial overhead in writing tests, especially when requirements are not well-defined. Developers may need to adapt to a different mindset, which can be challenging. There's also a risk of incomplete test coverage, as developers might overlook some edge cases. As the codebase grows, maintaining test suites can become a time-consuming task, and an overemphasis on testing might detract from other development activities. The effectiveness of TDD depends on the project's context and the willingness of the development team to embrace TDD principles.
